            <br>
            <h3 class ="subtitle is-3">Our group has developed an application that suggests recipes for the user to
                make. The idea is that the user will input ingredients and food items that they have
                available to them at the time. While the user inputs their ingredients, the autocomplete
                function will shows potential suggestions for what the user may be inputting. In return, the
                app will search through a database of recipes, find recipes that use most (if not all) of the
                ingredients the user input, and return those recipes. The user will have the option of creating an account to
                store the history of their queries.

                For the public data store, any user will be allowed to query for recipes and have access to the 
                database of random recipes. For the private data store, users will gain access to the wine pairing
                database and can see and request pairings for certain foods. For the user data store, users will be 
                able to adjust their login information, delete their account, and view their past recipe queries. 
                The third party API that we are using is Spoonacular's public API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api). This API
                contains recipes and nutritional information that we can provide our users with.</h3>
