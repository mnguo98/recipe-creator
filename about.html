            <h3>Our group has developed an application that suggests recipes for the user to
                make. The idea is that the user will input ingredients and food items that they have
                available to them at the time. While the user inputs their ingredients, the autocomplete
                function will shows potential suggestions for what the user may be inputting. In return, the
                app will search through a database of recipes, find recipes that use most (if not all) of the
                ingredients the user input, and return those recipes. If the recipe requires more
                ingredients, the user will be notified. The user will have the option of creating an account to
                store the history of their queries, favorite recipes for future reference, and potentially make
                posts to suggest recipes to other users.

                For the public data store, any user will be allowed to query for recipes and submit
                other recipes for the database. For the private data store, users will have the benefit of
                making posts reviewing recipes that they have tried as well as interacting with other posts
                made. For the user data store, users will be able to adjust their login information, view their
                favorites and posts, and set their recipes preferences. The third party API that we will most
                likely use is spoonacular.comâ€™s public API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api). This API
                contains recipes and nutritional information that we can provide our users with.</h3>
